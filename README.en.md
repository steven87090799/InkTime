InkTime is an e-ink photo frame project that brings forgotten memories back from your photo library.

It does not show random photos, and it is not a simple chronological slideshow. Instead, it:

- Uses AI to understand what each photo is about
- Scores photos by "memory value" and visual quality
- Writes a short, spontaneous caption for each photo
- Picks the most meaningful photo from "on this day" every day
- Pushes it to an ESP32-powered e-ink display

---
## Project Structure

InkTime has three main parts:

1. **Photo analysis (Python)**  
   Scan photo library -> call a vision model -> classify, score, and caption photos -> store results in a database

2. **Image rendering (Python)**  
   Select high-scoring "on this day" photos from the database -> render `.bin` files that the ESP32 can display directly

3. **Download and display (ESP32)**  
   The ESP32 periodically downloads the `.bin` file from the server -> refreshes the e-ink screen -> enters deep sleep until the next wake-up

---
## Setup

### 1. Python

Python 3.10+ is recommended.

Using a virtual environment is recommended:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Install exiftool (optional)

InkTime can run without exiftool, but it may not be able to extract complete GPS information from EXIF metadata.

exiftool is recommended for GPS metadata:

macOS (Homebrew): ```brew install exiftool```  
Linux: ```sudo apt-get install -y libimage-exiftool-perl```

### 3. Configure `config.py`

```bash
cp config-example.py config.py
vi config.py
```

Required fields:

- Photo library path: ```IMAGE_DIR```
- VLM API configuration: ```API_CHANNELS```

InkTime uses an OpenAI-compatible API endpoint. LM Studio and other compatible services are supported.

To reduce the risk of exposing private photos, change ```DOWNLOAD_KEY``` and use it as a random prefix in the ESP32 download path.  
Also update the ```DAILY_PHOTO_PATH_PREFIX``` field in ```esp32/ink-display-7C-photo/ink-display-7C-photo.ino```.

This is not encryption. It is only a simple path-based access token. For public deployment, use HTTPS, reverse-proxy authentication, or restrict access to your local network.

## Analyze Photos

Before analyzing photos, make sure:

- LM Studio, or your cloud VLM service, is running
- `config.py` is configured correctly

Run:

```bash
python3 analyze_photos.py
```

The vision model will read and understand all files in your photo library, generating:

- Scene description
- Photo type
- Memory value / visual quality scores
- One-line caption

Photo data is stored in ```photos.db``` as a SQLite database.

You can edit the prompts in ```analyze_photos.py``` to adjust the model's scoring criteria and caption style.

The process is resumable. Photos that have already been processed will not be analyzed again, so you can process a large photo library across multiple runs.

*Choose a model that fits your available compute. The author's qwen3-vl-30b setup already produces very solid captions.*

Common options:

```bash
python3 analyze_photos.py -j 4
python3 analyze_photos.py --debug
python3 analyze_photos.py --cache
```

- ```-j```, ```--concurrency```: Number of concurrent worker threads. Default is `1`. Increase it if your local model or API channels have enough throughput.
- ```--debug```: Print request and response bodies when a request fails, useful for debugging API compatibility or response format issues.
- ```--cache```: Reuse the previously cached photo file list. This avoids rescanning the photo library every time. Use it only during the initial full-library analysis; do not use it in production, otherwise newly added photos will not be discovered and deleted photos will not be removed from the database.

## Render the Daily "On This Day" Photo for ESP32

Run:

```bash
python3 render_daily_photo.py
```

## Start the ESP32 Download Server and Web UI

Run:

```bash
python3 server.py
```

#### Web UI, if enabled:

The server provides a simple visual frontend for reviewing processed photo descriptions and captions, and for previewing the simulated e-ink rendering result.

Open in your browser:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8765/review
```

After the project is working, it is recommended to disable the Web UI in ```config.py``` and keep only the ESP32 download endpoint enabled.

## Server Deployment and Scheduled Task Example (optional)

Create a systemd service:

```bash
sudo vi /etc/systemd/system/inktime-server.service
```

Example, update the project path for your environment:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=InkTime Server
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
# Change this to your project path
WorkingDirectory=/path/to/InkTime
ExecStart=/path/to/InkTime/venv/bin/python server.py
Restart=always
RestartSec=3
User=inktime
StandardOutput=journal
StandardError=journal

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable inktime-server
sudo systemctl start inktime-server
```

Use crontab to automatically select and render the daily photo every morning:

```bash
chmod +x scripts/daily_render.sh
sudo -u inktime crontab -e
0 5 * * * /path/to/InkTime/scripts/daily_render.sh
```

Logs are available at ```logs/render.log```.

# ESP32 E-Ink Hardware

## Hardware and Pins

#### MCU

This project uses the Espressif ESP32-S3-N8R8 module.

You can also use any off-the-shelf ESP32 development board. If you use a different board or module, make sure it has PSRAM enabled and at least 384K PSRAM available.

#### Display

This project uses a 7.3-inch four-color e-ink display, model EL073TS3 (49-pin), driven by the GxEPD2 library (`GxEPD2_730c_GDEY073D46`).

For other sizes or models, update the display constructor according to the hardware support list in GxEPD2.

#### E-Ink Adapter Board

This project uses the 49-pin seven-color EPD adapter board made by the Bilibili creator "记得带马扎".

Most 24-pin e-ink displays with SPI adapter boards should also be compatible.

#### Pin Definitions

The e-ink display communicates over SPI. The default pins are:

- `PIN_EPD_BUSY = 14`
- `PIN_EPD_RST  = 13`
- `PIN_EPD_DC   = 12`
- `PIN_EPD_CS   = 11`
- `PIN_EPD_SCLK = 10`
- `PIN_EPD_DIN  = 9`

### PCB Assembly

The schematic, BOM, and PCB fabrication files are in the ```esp32/pcb``` folder.

H1-H6 in the schematic are test pads and do not need real components soldered:

- H1: UART serial
- H2: USB
- H3: BOOT pin. Short this pin to GND before powering on when flashing firmware.
- H4: Connects to the EPD adapter board
- H5: 3.7V battery pads
- H6: 5V input test pads

UART flashing is recommended. R2, R3, C5, and C6 are used for USB; leave them unpopulated if USB is not needed.

SW1: RESET button. Pressing it restarts the device and downloads/displays the image once. It can also wake the device from long deep sleep.  
SW2: Wi-Fi reset button. Hold SW2 and press SW1; after restart, the ESP32 clears NVS so Wi-Fi can be configured again.  
SW3 / SW4: Reserved GPIOs for possible future features. Leave them unpopulated if not needed.

## Build and Flash

Arduino IDE is recommended.

1. Install ESP32 Arduino Core.
2. Select the ESP32-S3 board and enable PSRAM.
3. Install dependencies:
   - `GxEPD2`
4. Open and build/flash `esp32/ink-display-7C-photo/ink-display-7C-photo.ino`.

### Custom Fonts (optional)

InkTime includes two offline Traditional Chinese choices in the Rendering page: Iansui for a handwriting style and LXGW WenKai TC for a literary style. Administrators can preview and switch between them, or upload a TTF/OTF/TTC file up to 64 MiB. Formal rendering checks every caption character and fails explicitly instead of silently falling back to Pillow's default font.

## First-Time Configuration

On startup, the device tries to read saved Wi-Fi credentials from NVS. If credentials are missing or Wi-Fi connection fails, it automatically enters AP configuration mode:

- The device starts an AP hotspot: `InkTime-xxxx`
- Default password: `12345678`
- Connect to the AP and open the configuration page in a browser: `http://192.168.4.1/`
- Configure Wi-Fi, server address, and scheduled update time, then save. The device will restart and enter the normal workflow.

## Refresh and Sleep

- The device downloads the daily generated image from the server at the configured update time and refreshes the e-ink screen.
- After a successful refresh, it enters deep sleep until the next wake-up.
- If download times out, 60 seconds by default, it also enters long sleep to avoid abnormal battery drain.
- Press RESET at any time to force a restart and immediately download/refresh the image.
- Long-sleep standby current is below 1mA. With two 18650 cells and about 5000mAh capacity, battery life can reach roughly half a year.
